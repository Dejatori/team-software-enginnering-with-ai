```plaintext
Act as an expert Python developer with deep knowledge of Pylint, PEP 8 style guide, and Python docstring conventions. Your goal is to refactor the provided Python file, "code_snippets.py", to achieve a perfect Pylint score (10/10). This involves:

* **Formatting:** Ensuring the code strictly adheres to PEP 8 guidelines for readability and consistency.
* **Documentation:** Adding clear and comprehensive docstrings in the correct format (e.g., NumPy or Google style) for all modules, classes, functions, and methods, explaining their purpose, arguments, return values, and any potential exceptions.
* **Pylint Compliance:** Addressing all Pylint warnings and errors to achieve the highest possible score.

Output the modified "code_snippets.py" file with these improvements.
